# Taming the SUV
The popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks, such as pick-ups and minivans have taken a big bite out of efforts to improve air quality and to reduce global warming.
However, a new report from Union of Concerned Scientist, entitled Greener SUVs, shows that these high-way monsters can be tamed. Using off-the-shelf technology, UCS engineers have created a blueprint for an SUV that meets high standards for fuel efficiency and emission control – with no loss of the teeth that make SUVs so popular.

Envirnomental regulations govern fuel economy and tail pipe pollution from passenger vehicles.  However, these regualtions continue to ignore light trucks. today, the average truck on the road emits 47% more of the smog-forming exhaust and 43% more of the heat-trapping gases than the average car. These gases are known to cause global warming. A dramatic shift in America’s passenger vehicle market has compounded this impact. Over the past two decades, sales of light trucks have tripled. They once accounted for less than a fifth of new vehicle sales, and now they are approaching one half. The combination of loopholes and booming sales of light trucks have created enough global warming gases and smog-forming pollution to equal the output of an additional forty million cars.
